# Business Logic:
DataHarmonize operates on a sound business logic foundation:
Transformation plays a crucial role in this project to ensure the data is clean, consistent, and suitable for analysis and processing. Here are some logics you can apply on this project

Customers:

•	Convert phone_number to a standardized format:
    o	This transformation ensures that all phone numbers follow a consistent format, such as removing special characters, adding country codes, or applying a specific pattern.
    
•	Trim leading and trailing whitespace from first_name and last_name:
    o	This transformation removes any unnecessary whitespace at the beginning or end of the customer's first and last names, ensuring clean and consistent data.
    
•	Convert email to lowercase:
    o	This transformation converts all email addresses to lowercase, ensuring uniformity and avoiding potential duplicates caused by case differences.

Products:

•	Convert price to the appropriate numeric data type:
    o	This transformation converts the price column from a string or any other non-numeric format to the appropriate numeric data type (e.g., float or decimal), allowing for accurate calculations and comparisons.
    
•	Normalize string values in product_name, description, color, and material:
    o	This transformation standardizes the string values by removing special characters, accents, or leading/trailing spaces, ensuring consistent formatting across the dataset.

Transactions:

•	Convert timestamp to a standardized date and time format:
    o	This transformation converts the timestamp column to a standardized date and time format (e.g., ISO 8601) for better compatibility, easier analysis, and consistent representation of the transaction time.
    
•	Calculate total_amount by adding subtotal and tax_amount:
    o	This transformation computes the total amount of each transaction by summing the subtotal and tax_amount columns, providing a consolidated view of the transaction value.


Inventory:

•	Convert last_updated and restocking_date to a standardized date and time format:
    o	This transformation converts the last_updated and restocking_date columns to a standardized date and time format, facilitating consistent time-based analysis and comparisons.

Promotions:
•	Convert start_date and end_date to a standardized date format:
    o	This transformation converts the start_date and end_date columns to a standardized date format, enabling consistent analysis of promotion durations and comparisons.

StoreLocations:
•	Convert opening_time and closing_time to a standardized time format:
    o	This transformation converts the opening_time and closing_time columns to a standardized time format, allowing for consistent representation and analysis of store opening and closing hours.

Suppliers:
•	Trim leading and trailing whitespace from supplier_name, contact_person, and business_type:
    o	This transformation removes any unnecessary whitespace at the beginning or end of supplier_name, contact_person, and business_type, ensuring clean and consistent data.
    
•	Convert phone_number and contact_number to standardized format:
    o	This transformation standardizes the phone_number and contact_number columns by applying a consistent format or removing special characters, ensuring uniformity and ease of use in contact information.
    
•	Convert email to lowercase:
    o	This transformation converts all email addresses in the email column to lowercase, ensuring consistency and avoiding potential duplicates caused by case differences.

DeliveryTracking:
•	Convert estimated_delivery_date and actual_delivery_date to a standardized date format:
        o	This transformation converts the estimated_delivery_date and actual_delivery_date columns to a standardized date format, facilitating consistent analysis and comparison of delivery dates.

Overall, this project's transformations lay the foundation for robust data engineering, enabling efficient data processing, analysis, and decision-making. The transformed datasets provide a reliable and consistent basis for further exploration, modeling, and extracting valuable insights to support business objectives and drive data-driven strategies.
